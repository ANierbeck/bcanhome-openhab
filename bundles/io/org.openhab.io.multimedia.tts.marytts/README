In order to successfully use Mary TTS when launching the openHAB runtime from within your IDE, 
you need a couple of additional libraries in the lib folder.

The required jars are available at http://code.google.com/p/openhab/source/browse/?repo=marytts
Simply copy all those jars (you can download them all as a single zip) to the "lib" folder of this bundle and you are done.

Note that this step is automatically done during the Maven build (see the pom.xml), so if you have triggered the Maven build
at least once, everything should already be in place.
