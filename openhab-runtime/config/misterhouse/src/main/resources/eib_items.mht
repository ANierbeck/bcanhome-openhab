# EIB items.
#
# EIB type 1. On/off switch items.
# One address, normally readable
# "Other Info" specifies mode: "R" (Readable) means that the current value of the item can
# be obtained by sending a "read" request on the bus.
#
EIB1, 1/1/11, Küche_Table, Meine_Lights|Kitchen, R
# EIB type 1 groups: all items that listen to a group address.
# "Address" is the group address, "Other Info" is the addresses of all items that listen to that
# address.
#
EIB1G, 1/1/20, Kitchen_all_lights, All_Lights|Kitchen, 1/1/11|1/1/21
#
# EIB type 2. Dimmer switch items.
# AN EIB dimmer consists of three different items, with different addresses: position,
# control, and value.
# Position is for switching the light on/off (EIB1), control is for starting/stopping
# dimming and brightening, and value for setting a specific brightness level (0-100).
#
# The "address" of a type 2 item is the combination of three addresses: "position"|"control"|"value".
# The control and value items are automatically set to readable mode.
#
EIB2, 1/1/21|1/1/22|1/4/2, Kitchen_dimmer, All_Lights|Kitchen
#
# EIB type 5. "Real" values, as for example generated by weather stations.
# "Other Info" specifies mode, see EIB type 1.
#
EIB5, 2/0/10, Windspeed, Weather, R
#
# EIB type 7. Drives, for controlling motors for blinds, windows, etc.
# An EIB drive consists of two different items, with different addresses: move and stop/step.
# Move is for starting movement up/down, stop/step is for stopping movement or stepping the motor.
#
# The "address" of a type 7 item is the combination of two addresses: "move"|"stop/step".
# Note that drives are not readable -- reading a drive may cause it to move!
#
# Usually EIB7-actuators can operate in two different operating modes: "shutter" or "blind"
# "Other Info" specifies the operating mode. If omitted a shutter is assumed. 
# Therefore, the two possibilities for shutters are as follows:
# 
EIB7, 2/1/0|2/1/1, Kitchen_Shutter, Kitchen|All_Blinds
EIB7, 2/1/2|2/1/3, Kitchen_Shutter, Kitchen|All_Blinds, shutter
#
# If you have a blind instead, declare it like this:
#
EIB7, 2/1/4|2/1/5, Kitchen_Blind, Kitchen|All_Blinds, blind
