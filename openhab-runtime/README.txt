openHAB Runtime Instructions
============================

Thanks for downloading openHAB and installing openHAB!

By extracting the runtime zip file, you are already ready to go.
All you have to do is to launch the runtime by calling "run.sh" (resp. "run.bat" on Windows).

Point your web browser to http://localhost:8080/system/console to see if everything is
up and running correctly.

Have fun with openHAB!
